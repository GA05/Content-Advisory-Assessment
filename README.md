**Severity Level:** High  

**Internal Notes:**  
The movie depicts extreme graphic violence such  as  brutal  gunplay, bloodshed, and disturbing family trauma. Multiple  scenes  depict  violent hand-to-hand combats,  with  a  variety  of  traumatic  emotional abuse within families. While the film received  a  CBFC A (Adult) rating, any  threats of violence coupled with emotional abuse and  the Nudity makes  it  unsuitable for children.

**Title:** Dangerous Liaisons (2022)  
**Season/Episode:** N/A  
**Genre:** Teen Drama / Romance  
**Language:** French (Dubbed/Available in multiple languages including English)  

**Flagged Content (check all that apply):**  
- [ ] Violence

- [ ] Historical  

**Severity Level:** Moderate  

**Internal Notes:**  
The movie  revolves around adolescent  love, infidelity, and the exploitation of sexual relationships. It  also includes adolescent sexual intimacy,  a non-consensual filming, and emotional exploitation,  all  of which would contravene Indian CBFC's "decency and morality" standards. If  the film  were  given  a  theatrical  release  in  India,  it would be an A (Adult) rating.  The CBFC would probably  ask  for scenes depicting revenge porn  to  be  blurred  or  cut  out, and they  would  more  likely  than  not  bleep  out vulgar,  derogatory, or otherwise  offending  language. There  is  no  violence, or religious or  political  content.
